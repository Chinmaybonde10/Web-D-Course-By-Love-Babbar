        <p>n the TV series "Dark," the concept of time travel and alternate timelines plays a significant role. Without giving away too many spoilers, it's important to note that the events in the show are not always linear and can be influenced by actions taken in different time periods. Therefore, the existence of older Jonas and Adam is not solely dependent on the actions of Martha and younger Jonas in a linear cause-and-effect manner. The show explores complex themes of determinism, free will, and the interconnectedness of different timelines, which contribute to the characters' existence in various forms across time.

            This is a really great and complicated question! I'll try to answer it as simply as possible
            
            The Show doesn't give a very detailed explanation for this but it does explain the reason for it. To understand this you need to go back to the part of the show where Tannhaus was giving a speech about schrodinger's cat. There he explains that while the box is closed, we actually don't know if the cat was dead or alive. It is, in a sense, Alive and dead at the same time. From the moment you open the box it becomes clear which is true but until that both options remain equally true.

            How was Jonas alive to grow up and be Adam when alternate world Martha killed him and he only exists in 1 world?
            This is because of quantum entanglement which gives rise to two overlapping realities.
            
            First reality :
            
            On the day of apocalypse , Adam came and shot Martha in front of Jonas. After that , alternate world Martha arrived in the scenario and with the help of her time travel sphere, took Jonas to the alternate world to save him from the apocalypse . Jonas was left bewildered by seeing the mirror version of Winden caves. Later , he found that this mirror world of Winden was a world without Jonas , where Mikkel had not time travelled back to 1986 ,Martha was dating Killian Obendorf and Franziska was d… (more)

            In Dark Micheal had to die in order to save Jonas. But how?
            Hello there!
            
            You asked Why Micheal had to die to save Jonas?
            
            
            Let’s see why. Warning! Spoilers ahead!
            
            “All pieces should be in the place, in order to become what i am now.”
            
            This is one of the dialogues literally told by many character in the series, including Adam,Eve,Claudia,The stranger. All the events should be taken place eventually in order, so that the timeline is secured and cycle continues. Adam did that to finally destroy the both worlds. Eve did that to make the cycle repeat again and ensures her son lives. And Claudia did that for a Regina’s life.
            
            This is my theory of how Michael’s death … (more)

            How come middle aged Jonas does not know about the other world while Adam knows in Dark (Netflix series)?
            To be honest the series is very very complicated to understand. Hence you need your full presence of mind to be focused on it which is extremely difficult.

            Martha from another world did not save Jonas. He hid in the basement and saved himself. Then met Claudia and Noah (2053) and he is the one who came back as Stanger in 2019 in the first and second season. He then traveled to 1888 and became Adam.

            That is because of quantum entanglement.
            
            In one possible situation, mirror world Martha took Jonas to her world just before the apocalypse, later he died there.
            
            In the other situation, mirror world Bartosz stopped mirror world Martha to save Jonas and bring him in their mirror world to show the reality. Jonas saved himself from the apocalypse by hiding in the bunker and later he became the older Jonas.</p>
